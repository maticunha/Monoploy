# Monopoly
Final Project for COMP SCI 1050
Monopoly Report

Description

This is the README file for the Monopoly Project (final project COMP1050)

Why? 
This is a game that everybody knows about and grew up playing. 
We decided to take a different twist on monopoly and make it more applicable to our time in COMP1050. 

How? 
We did this by designing different classes and methods that apply to the conecpts of Monnopoly. 
These methods have different functions for things like jail, switching turns, owning properties, moving the pieces, etc. 

Deliverables 
Frontend- Our frontend is a GUI built in SceneBuilder. It is a computer science monopoly board with coding languages as properties as well 
as technology companies for the railroads. These different properties represent the coding languages a player will learn and add to their resume. 
As players learn more languages,(buy more properties), they earn more money over time. 

Backend- The backend consists of 6 different classes, two interfaces and an FXML file. They are named, App, Event, Jail, Player, Property, Space, and two Interfaces called Board and Die.  
Each one represents a different aspect of Monopoly. App is the class that controls the GUI, Event is a class that contains every event that could happen in the game,
Jail is the class that control when the player is sent to jail and when they will get out, Player is the class that controls everything that has to do with 
each player, Property sets the position of each property and whether or not it's bought, Board is an interface for the different aspects of the board, , 
Die is an interface that controls the dice rolling and generates a random number for each die.

Getting Started (10 pts)

Install
To install the project, the user must download the entire Monopoly project. They may use whatever IDE they would like. In our case, we 
used Eclipse. 

Run
To run the project, the user must run the App.Java file and the GUI will launch from there. 

Features

Feature #1- Built in GUI that looks just like a normal Monopoly Board.
Feature #2- We built a log right into the center of the Board to show everything that is happening in the game. 
Feature #3 - Real life scenarios built right into the game. These are senarious that computer science lovers will enjoy. 

Demo video 
Upload your demo video to youtube and put a link here. Basically, the video content is very much like the quick live demo you gave during your final presentation with the followings:

Project description
How to run the app
Quick walkthrough of all the features of your app
Make it short (<= 2 mins) and interesting.

Here is an example of a demo video of a chat program developed by Ethan Arrowood and his team (the first 6 minutes). YOU DO NOT NEED TO SHOW HOW YOUR CODE WORKS IN THE DEMO VIDEO!!!
